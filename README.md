Environment Generating Game Experiment. I so love the game Don'r Starve, this repository is an experiment to see how generated environment for rogue-like game combine with complex game elements (creatures, cultures, weather, etc..). 


Also want to combine this with my own game design plan. 

All the materials will be upload in here, if anyone want to use those, please cite this repository.
